DistroTestProject
=================

This is an example site implementing the [DistroTest](https://github.com/BluesparkLabs/DistroTest)
installation profile.

It relies on Drush Make as the mechanism for building and deploying the codebase.

The only modules you should add to this repository should be custom modules, 
themes and features, placed in `sites/all/modules/custom/`, `sites/all/themes/custom/`,
and `sites/all/modules/custom_features/` respectively.


Refer to the DistroTest README.md for further usage instructions.
